        <h2>Hello!</h2>
        <h2>My name is Kobe.</h2>
        <p>I'm a multimedia artist and graphic designer from Mississippi. I have a B.A. in Communication Design from
            Washington University in St. Louis. I like to explore the relationship between music and visual arts.</p>
        <p>My life revolves around my hobbies. Everything I do is a means to fund my hobbies.</p>
        <p>I've played percussion since middle school and am now formally trained. More recently, I've picked up guitar
            and synthesis.</p>
        <p>I've always enjoyed drawing, but I didn't decide to study art until third semester of college. I studied
            graphic design, but I also took many studio art courses. I found that I was drawn to the more open-ended
            approach of making art rather than the stricter confines of graphic design. My work explores the boundary
            between design and art as a means of emotional connection. I emphasize craft and detail in my work. I take
            inspiration from visual artists such as Ai Weiwei, Kehide Wiley, Marina Abromovic, Marcel Duchamp, Max
            Ernst, and many others from the surrealist movement. Some of the musicians that influence my work are Bjork,
            Imogen Heap, SOPHIE, and the Twilight soundtracks.</p>
